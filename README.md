# DESIGN-AND-FABRICATION-OF-PNEUMATIC-REGENERATIVE-BRAKING-SYSTEM

## AIM:

Regenerative braking is the effective method of braking that stores
the energy lost in braking as a form of energy, usually electrical
energy. Tesla motors was the first company to innovate this feature and
successfully commercialize it. There are many ongoing researches in this
topic.
 This project comes with the idea of storing the energy in the form of
compressed air( pneumatic energy ). Using the back pressure created
inside the silencer to effectively brake the bike by controlling the exhaust
pressure based on braking requirement
 And successfully implemented the above idea and tested it. Have also developed a working model to simultaneously saved the air
compressed during braking.

More details on the report.
